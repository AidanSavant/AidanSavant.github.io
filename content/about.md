*The method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept.*

## Introduction
Hello! I am Aidan, an 18-year-old freshman (2025) at Neumont College of Computer Science.

I am thoroughly interested in programming, CS theory, designing systems, low-level applications, operating systems, computer hardware, compilers, networking, data structures and algorithms, and other components that seamlessly build modern-day applications.

However, I am not just interested in computers but anything science. This ranges from physics, math, electrical engineering, astronomy, music theory, philosophy, psychology, and numerous other disciplines.

## Why?
The reason why Iâ€™ve created this blogging website is not only to showcase cool projects that demonstrate my skills and abilities but also to express my affinity for teaching, hence the name of the blog.

With that being said, not only will I showcase projects, but I will also provide walkthroughs and explanations for generally complex topics that are hard to explain and hard to understand.

In the beginning, I plan on keeping my posts related to computer science theory and other branches it encapsulates, but I plan on covering numerous practical concepts not only related to computer science but other fields of science.
